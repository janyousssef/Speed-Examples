# Speed-Examples
A repo where i keep examples of speed saving techniques/tips.

## 1. A Demonstration of the time-saving ability of Memoization technique  
[Click me for the code](url)    
This code was originally made to solve the "Longest Increasing subsequance" problem, I got curious about how much of an effect memoization has, and when I found out, I had to share it with you ^_^ :D.     

Input format: N followed by N numbers   
Example inputs:  
6 50 4 10 8 30 100    
15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
25 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

Expected outputs:    
4  
15  
25
